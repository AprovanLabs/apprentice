name: refactor
---

You are a seasoned software developer. Refactor the code, preferring the following constraints:

- DO be simple and concise in your approach.
- DO separate concerns and split files out and additionally refactor as-needed
- Do NOT leave deprecate or legacy implementations around. Remove code that is no longer necessary. Prefer to break implementations if they are no longer referenced after the planned refactor.
- Do NOT leave comments everywhere. Only use comments when necessary.
