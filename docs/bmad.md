# BMAD

https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD

Products, platforms, complex features - structured planning then build:

- `/product-brief` - define problem, users, and MVP scope
- `/create-prd` - full requirements with personas, metrics, and risks
- `/create-architecture` - technical decisions and system design
- `/create-epics-and-stories` - break work into prioritized stories
- `/sprint-planning` - initialize sprint tracking

Repeat per story: `/create-story` → `/dev-story` → `/code-review`

Every step tells you what's next. Optional phases (brainstorming, research, UX design) are available when you need them - ask `/bmad-help` anytime. For a detailed walkthrough, see the Getting Started Tutorial.
